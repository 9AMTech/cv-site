On Load
- There will be an intro splash that is almost like a tutorial
- "WHATEVER YOU TYPE HERE > WILL SHOW UP HERE!"
- literally simple, then you will hit a got it button and the splash will go away and display the page.

Actual page
- I'm thinking a double CV layout, it's a nice design
- the cv will start already built in the format the cv should look like
- itll have greyed out placeholder info and text
- the information will be plug in and formatted
